# OSED preparation

After completing the challenges and extra miles I did:


- Easy file sharing web server 7.2

- QuoteDB ([https://github.com/bmdyy/quote_db/](https://github.com/bmdyy/quote_db/))

- Signatus ([https://github.com/bmdyy/signatus](https://github.com/bmdyy/signatus))

- Vulnserver GMON

- Vulnserver GTER

- Vulnserver HTER

- Vulnserver KSTET

- Vulnserver LTER

- Vulnserver TRUN

- VUPlayer v2.49 - ROP using PUSHAD and VirtualProtect()

- Xitami

- DreamFTP - Note that I exploited this one in Windows 10 and I could overwrite EIP using format strings but could not create a ROP chain


Please note the exploits must be updated with a correct payload (I was using a custom reverse shell payload so I deleted it).
